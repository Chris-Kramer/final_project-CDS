# Running scrips

Before running the scripts it is importaint to know which order to do it in.
It is importaint to run the scripts in the folder called *wrangling* before running the scripts in the folder called *analysis* since the analysis-scripts depend on the data created by the wrangling-scripts.  
**NOTE: All data from the wrangling script is already provided in the data folder. So you are technically able to run those scripts without running the wrangling scripts first. But if you wish to reproduce the whole repo, you need to run it in the order specified above.**
