# The right order to run scripts in.

Run the scripts in this order, to create the nessasary data:
- 1_cleaning_rape_per_capita.R
- 2_pop_density_area.R
- 3_cleaning_tweets.R


<br>
The script: "twitter_scraping.R", cannot be ran unless you have a dewelloper acount. However you do not need to run it as the data we are using for the rest of the scripts have already been created.
